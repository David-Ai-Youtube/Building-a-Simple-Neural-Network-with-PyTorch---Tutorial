PyTorch Neural Network Project

This project demonstrates how to build a simple neural network using PyTorch. The network architecture consists of two fully connected layers with ReLU activation, and is trained on random input data.
Requirements

    Python 3
    PyTorch

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
cd project

Install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Run the main.py script:

    css

python main.py

The script will generate random input data and pass it through the neural network. The output tensor will be printed to the console.
